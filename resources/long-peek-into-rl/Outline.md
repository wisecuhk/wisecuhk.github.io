### Wise CUHK -- A Peek into RL

This week, we are going to briefly introduce some basic ideas in Reinforcement Learning -- one of the topics in "learning"  that I think Vincent would "run away from". 
The aim of this workshop is to equip our audience with the fundamental knowledge in reinforcement learning, while there is still much to explore if anyone find it interesting.
We hope that everyone will enjoy this short journey.
